We're pleased to announce the release of:

## Polymer 1.7

The primary goal of the upcoming Polymer 2.0 release is to take advantage of native, cross-browser support for Web Components. With this in mind, Polymer 1.7.0 provides forwards compatibility and initial support for migration. 

### `<slot>` element 

Elements can opt-in to using the new `<slot>` element and `::slotted()` CSS selector from ShadowDOM v1.

This is not required for current Polymer 1.x elements, but using the new syntax will make it easier to port elements to 2.x.

### `html` selector in `<style is="custom-style">`, `:host > * ` selector in elements

Polymer 2.x will remove the `:root` selector and replace it with `html` in `<style is="custom-style">`, and `:host > *` in element styles.
